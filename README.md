# Burnout

An interactive web app designed to help users focus on a single task with techniques in mindfulness. Burnout encourages productivity by training focus prior to each task and eliminates the phone as a potential distraction. This web app uses several APIs to aid in functionality like accessing a mobile device's gyroscope and accelerometer to simulate a graphical magnifying glass and accessing the microphone to measure the user's breathing pace. An interactive demo can be found here, and should be visited from a mobile browser.

This web app was developed for the Human-Computer Interaction Design course at the University of California, San Diego, with Professor Scott Klemmer.
